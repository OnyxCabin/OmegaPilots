It isn't until afterward that the asker realizes that Worthington didn't actually give any real information on himself.\r\n\r\nOn the battlefield, Worthington prefers a long range supporting fire role. With clear lines of fire it's easy to forget that there's only one of him.\r\n\r\nHe has a tattoo of a stylized crown on a yellow triskelion.\r\n\r\n",
