[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] used to work for me and {TGT_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:have|Default:has} something of a dark past. {TGT_MW.Subj} used to run with a crew called The Omega Squad, but there isn't any real information on them. No MRB records and I couldn't find anyone who would admit to hiring them, fighting for or against them, or had even heard of them. Total ghosts, at least in the Inner Sphere and Periphery. Maybe they stuck to the Deep Periphery, I don't know. But after I hired {SCN_MW.Subj} weird stuff started happening. Untraceable comms coming in from sources that shouldn't exist, dropships following us through jumps that they shouldn't be able to predict, and even a plague onboard. Morale tanked so badly that I had to let {TGT_MW.Subj} go. Frightening thing is that there's a bunch of ex-Omegas out there and everyone who's hired them has said the same thing. Watch your back out there, {COMMANDER.Callsign}.\"",
